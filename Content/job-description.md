# **Job Description**

## **Senior Director, GTM AI & Operations — Marketing**

### **Role Summary**

The Senior Director, GTM AI & Operations (Marketing) owns how marketing work gets done. This role designs, operationalizes, and continuously improves marketing execution through systems, workflows, analytics, and AI-enabled processes so Demand, Product Marketing, Content, and Enablement teams can execute faster, learn continuously, and demonstrate impact.

This role **does not own marketing strategy or outcomes**. Instead, it owns the execution engine that translates strategy into repeatable, measurable marketing operations.

### **Why This Role Exists**

Marketing execution has grown more complex across channels, tools, and buyer journeys. Without a unified operating system, teams move quickly but inconsistently, measurement fragments, and learning slows.

This role exists to build the **Marketing GTM Engine**: the systems, workflows, analytics, and AI-assisted processes that allow Marketing to scale execution efficiently while maintaining alignment with Revenue Operations and Sales.
