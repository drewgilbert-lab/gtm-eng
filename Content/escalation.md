# **Authority & Escalation Matrix**

---

## **Purpose of This Document**

This matrix exists to make authority explicit, prevent accountability without control, and ensure fast execution without organizational confusion.

It defines:

* What this role **decides**

* What it **influences**

* What it **executes**

* What it **escalates**

---

## **Decision Authority Framework**

Each responsibility is categorized as one of four types:

* **Owns** – Final decision authority

* **Executes** – Responsible for delivery, not decision

* **Influences** – Provides analysis and recommendation

* **Escalates** – Flags risk or conflict for leadership decision

---

## **1\. Strategy & Business Direction**

| Area | Authority Level | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Marketing strategy | ❌ Out of Scope | Explicitly not owned |
| Campaign themes & priorities | ❌ Out of Scope | Demand / PMM owned |
| Revenue targets | ❌ Out of Scope | Sales / Exec owned |
| GTM segmentation strategy | Influences | Provides data-driven insight only |
| ICP & persona definition | Influences | Enables research & synthesis |

**Escalation Trigger:**

Strategy lacks measurable inputs or cannot be operationalized with existing systems.

---

## **2\. Execution & Workflow Design**

| Area | Authority Level | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Marketing execution workflows | **Owns** | End-to-end workflow design |
| AI-assisted execution models | **Owns** | Guardrails \+ enablement |
| Process standardization | **Owns** | Across Marketing execution |
| Execution prioritization | Executes | Strategy sets priorities |
| Experimentation frameworks | **Owns** | How tests run, not what to test |

**Escalation Trigger:**

Execution blocked due to unclear ownership or conflicting requests.

---

## **3\. Analytics, Measurement & Learning**

| Area | Authority Level | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Marketing analytics | **Owns** | Team \+ outputs |
| Metric definitions (Marketing) | **Owns** | Aligned with RevOps |
| Attribution modeling | Influences | RevOps partnership |
| Performance reporting | **Owns** | Trusted source |
| Post-mortems | **Owns** | Mandatory for learning |

**Escalation Trigger:**

Disagreement over metric definitions or interpretation impacting decisions.

---

## **4\. Systems, Tools & Architecture**

| Area | Authority Level | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Marketing tools | **Owns** | Day-to-day ownership |
| AI tooling for Marketing | **Owns** | Usage & governance |
| Tool evaluation | **Owns** | Pilot → recommendation |
| GTM data standards | Influences | RevOps alignment |
| Salesforce schema | ❌ Out of Scope | RevOps owned |

**Escalation Trigger:**

New tool adoption conflicts with GTM data integrity or security standards.

---

## **5\. Cross-Functional Interfaces**

| Partner | Authority Level | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Demand Gen | Executes | Supports execution |
| Product Marketing | Executes | Enables output |
| Content | Executes | Workflow enablement |
| Enablement | Executes | Learning loops |
| Sales | Influences | Field insights |
| RevOps | Partners | Shared standards |

**Escalation Trigger:**

Repeated execution friction due to unclear handoffs.

---

## **6\. People & Team Management**

| Area | Authority Level | Notes |

| Marketing Ops | **Owns** | Direct report |
| Marketing Analytics | **Owns** | Direct report |

## **7\. Governance & Risk Management**

| Area | Authority Level | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| AI usage policies (Marketing) | **Owns** | With Legal/Security |
| Brand guardrails | Executes | PMM alignment |
| Compliance workflows | Executes | Legal partnership |
| Data privacy | Escalates | Security owned |

**Escalation Trigger:**

AI or tooling introduces compliance or reputational risk.

---

## **Escalation Principles (Important)**

This role escalates when:

1. Accountability exceeds authority

2. Execution is blocked by unresolved ownership

3. Data definitions conflict across GTM teams

4. Strategy cannot be operationalized safely

5. Learning is ignored after repeated failure

Escalation is a **last-mile safety mechanism**, not a management bypass.

---

## **Why This Matrix Matters**

Without this structure:

* Execution slows

* Accountability blurs

* AI adoption becomes unsafe

* The role becomes a catch-all

With it:

* Marketing moves faster

* Learning compounds

* RevOps alignment is preserved

* Leadership gets clarity, not noise
