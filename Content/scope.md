## Thesis statement

This role exists to own how work gets done across Marketing’s GTM execution layer—systems, workflows, automation, measurement, and the operating cadence that turns strategy into repeatable execution.

### What this unlocks

When this operating layer is missing or fragmented, teams end up:  
	•	Shipping fast but inconsistently (quality varies; compliance/SEO/analytics are missed)  
	•	Operating in disconnected tools and spreadsheets  
	•	Lacking clear feedback loops (what’s working vs. not, and why)  
	•	Repeating the same work across teams because there’s no shared execution engine

The thesis of the org design is: speed \+ quality \+ measurability come from a centralized execution and measurement layer, with explicit handoffs to strategy owners.

## 2\) Defensible scope

The “what I own” line

What I would own is the systems, execution and analysis, not the strategy.

That includes three functional pillars reporting into this role:

### A) Marketing Analytics (1 person → expands)

Marketing analytics reports into me. I do not own strategy, but my team owns the analysis to provide to Demand to make better decisions. This is a workflow I’d like to build out.

#### Scope of Marketing Analytics under this role:

	•	Funnel and lifecycle analysis that connects marketing activity → SDR follow-up → opportunities → pipeline → closed-won (and later, retention/expansion where applicable)  
	•	Experimentation measurement and learning loops (test design support, measurement plans, insights readouts)  
	•	Standard reporting packages for Demand, PMM, Sales, and RevOps (cadence-driven)  
	•	Data quality monitoring related to marketing lifecycle measurement (definitions, consistency, completeness)

Important boundary: Analytics does not set the strategy; it provides the operating truth that strategy owners use.

### B) Marketing Ops (1 person)

Marketing ops reports into me to ensure alignment on process and systems.

#### Scope of Marketing Ops under this role:

	•	Operational ownership of marketing systems administration and process configuration (in alignment with RevOps)  
	•	Lifecycle configuration support (routing rules, SLAs, views, campaign plumbing, attribution scaffolding)  
	•	Tool governance: intake, evaluation, rollout standards, and adoption support

Important boundary: Marketing Ops is not a general “ticket desk.” It is the operational arm of the GTM execution engine.

### C)GTM Engineering (new function)

GTM engineering reports into me and runs the execution.

#### Scope of GTM Engineering under this role:

	•	AI-first workflow design: how work is created, transformed, distributed, tracked, and improved  
	•	Execution engine: converting inputs (PMM messaging, Demand strategy, content assets) into campaigns, nurture, outbound experiments, and sales enablement outputs—fast, consistent, measurable  
	•	Automation and augmentation: where AI can reduce cycle time without dropping quality  
	•	Operational documentation: playbooks, templates, QA checklists, prompts, and enablement that make execution repeatable

## 3\) Explicit non-scope

### Additional guardrails (to avoid role failure)

These are the most common ways this type of role fails—so they must be explicitly out of scope unless authority and resources change:  
	•	Owning prioritization itself without clear decision rights (this becomes strategy ownership by another name)  
	•	Being accountable for outcomes without authority (measured like Demand/PMM, but without the levers they control)  
	•	Becoming the default owner of “everything broken” across GTM because the role is adjacent to systems

If Scott asks for prioritization ownership before agreeing to the role, the pushback is:  
	•	“The request doesn’t seem to be inline with the role. The existing teams should execute as is while I get this operational, which will speed up all execution.”

If asked after joining the team, this needs to be proactively addressed in the JD as a boundary:  
	•	“I can run the operating system and the learning loops, but strategy owners decide what gets prioritized. My team ensures it is executed fast, consistently, and measurably.”

## 4\) Minimal authority set

This role only works if it has minimum viable authority to enforce how work gets done.

### Minimum authority required

	1\.	Process authority

	•	Authority to define and enforce the standard GTM execution workflows (intake → build → QA → launch → measure → post-mortem)  
	•	Ability to require that launches meet baseline standards (tracking, compliance, handoffs) before going live

	2\.	Systems authority

	•	Authority to manage marketing operations and analytics resources directly  
	•	Authority to co-govern tool decisions with RevOps (no unilateral tool adoption)

	3\.	Measurement authority

	•	Authority to set definitions for measurement outputs (what gets measured, how, and how often)  
	•	Authority to run the operating cadence: weekly/biweekly performance reviews, experiment readouts, post-mortems

	4\.	Operating cadence authority

	•	Authority to run post-mortems and ensure follow-through  
	•	Authority to require attendance/inputs from partner teams when the workflow demands it

### What I will not ask for (and why)

	•	I will not ask for strategy ownership. That’s explicitly not the point.  
	•	I will not ask to control PMM or Demand headcount directly, but I will require clear handoffs and SLAs.
