# **How the Role Works with Marketing**

## **Purpose of This Document**

This document explains how the **role** partners with other marketing leaders and teams to improve execution, measurement, and learning — **without owning strategy or business outcomes**.

The goal is to:

* Clarify ownership boundaries

* Prevent duplication of effort

* Enable faster, more measurable execution

* Establish a shared operating model across Marketing

---

## **Core Operating Principle**

**Marketing leaders own strategy.**  
**This role owns how strategy gets executed, measured, and improved.**

This role functions as the **execution backbone** for Marketing — enabling teams to move faster with less friction while preserving autonomy over decisions.

## **What This Role Does** 

## **Not**

##  **Do**

To avoid confusion, this role explicitly does **not**:

* Override marketing leadership decisions

* Own campaign success or failure

* Replace strategic thinking with AI

* Act as a centralized approval gate

This is an **enablement role**, not a control function.

---

## **Why This Model Works**

Without this role:

* Teams execute inconsistently

* Measurement fragments

* Learnings are lost

* AI adoption is risky and uneven

With this role:

* Execution is faster

* Measurement is trusted

* Learning compounds

* Strategy improves over time

---

## **Key Safeguard**

**If strategy fails, this role improves how failure is understood — not who is blamed.**

That distinction is essential for trust.
