## **The Correct 5-Factor Workflow Prioritization Model**

Each workflow is scored on **five dimensions**, not four.

### **1\.** 

### **Leverage (Primary Impact)**

*If this exists, how many other workflows get easier or unnecessary?*

This is your **highest-order impact**.

Example:

* A unified performance signal workflow affects:

  * demand optimization

  * content prioritization

  * sales enablement

  * post-mortems

That’s massive impact — without owning revenue.

---

### **2\.** 

### **Dependency**

*Does this unlock other workflows or require them first?*

This ensures you build the system in the right order.

---

### **3\.** 

### **Signal Integrity Risk**

*Are decisions currently being made with incomplete, biased, or misleading data?*

This captures hidden impact:

* bad strategy

* wasted spend

* internal thrash

Fixing this has enormous downstream effects.

---

### **4\.** 

### **Execution Friction**

*Where is the organization losing time, rework, or trust today?*

This is **operational impact**, not financial impact.

---

### **5\.** 

### **Outcome Exposure (Guardrail)**

*If this workflow fails, am I implicitly accountable for outcomes I don’t own?*

This is the safety valve.

High exposure \= deprioritize or explicitly negotiate scope.
