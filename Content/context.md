# **📌 Project Context: Sr Director GTM AI & Ops — Marketing / RevOps Interface**

## **1\. Role Context & Political Reality (Ground Truth)**

* The user is currently in **Revenue Operations** and prefers to remain there.

* The **CEO has asked the new CMO (Scott)** to create a new senior role focused on AI, GTM, and Marketing execution.

* The CEO’s motivations include:

  1. Demonstrating increased investment in Marketing after prior underperformance

  2. Reducing costs or headcount pressure within Operations

* Scott is new, does not yet deeply understand the value of this role, and may be attempting to **appease the CEO** rather than proactively architecting the function.

* The user’s boss (RevOps leader) supports the user staying in RevOps and is actively socializing this position with the CEO.

* As a result, **two parallel role constructions** are being developed:

  1. A **RevOps-centered GTM Engine role** (preferred outcome)

  2. A **Marketing-centered execution role** (fallback / alternative)

Both versions must be defensible, scoped, and non-overlapping.

---

## **2\. Core Role Thesis (Shared Across Versions)**

**This role exists to own how work gets done — not what work gets prioritized.**

Key principles:

* Own **systems, workflows, execution, analytics, and learning loops**

* Do **not** own strategy, targets, or outcomes

* Enable other leaders (Demand, PMM, Content, Sales, Enablement) to execute faster and learn more effectively

* Prevent “speeding up failure” by improving *how* decisions are informed, not *what* decisions are made

---

## **3\. Marketing-Specific Role Scope (Fallback Option)**

If the role lives in Marketing, it is scoped as:

### **Owns**

* Marketing execution operating system

* Marketing analytics and performance intelligence

* Marketing operations and tooling

* AI-enabled execution workflows

* Post-mortems and institutional learning

* Cross-functional execution enablement

### **Does NOT Own**

* Marketing strategy

* Messaging, positioning, or campaign themes

* Budget ownership or revenue targets

* Sales execution or post-sale lifecycle ownership

This role **optimizes execution**, not business outcomes.

---

## **4\. Relationship to RevOps (Non-Negotiable)**

* RevOps remains the **system of record** for:

  * GTM definitions

  * Lifecycle stages

  * Revenue data integrity

* Marketing GTM AI & Ops:

  * Partners with RevOps on standards and integration

  * Owns marketing-side execution and instrumentation

* Ownership is determined by **who does the work**, not org charts.

---

## **5\. Workflow-Centric Operating Model**

All work is framed as **Workflows**, not tasks or projects.

### **A Workflow is defined by four criteria:**

1. End-to-end

2. Cross-functional

3. Repeatable

4. AI-relevant

---

## **6\. Standard Workflow Structure (Locked Reference)**

Every workflow is defined using the **same 9-point structure**:

1. Objective

2. Trigger

3. Inputs

4. Processing

5. Outputs

6. Consumers

7. Decisions Informed

8. Quality Checks

9. Failure & Feedback Loop

This structure is a **standing reference** and must not be altered.

---

## **7\. Workflow Categories (Ideal-State Coverage)**

Nine workflow categories were defined to represent the full Marketing execution surface area:

1. Market & Segment Intelligence

2. ICP, Persona & Use Case Development

3. Content & Messaging Execution

4. Campaign & Distribution Execution

5. Inbound, Nurture & Conversion Enablement

6. Sales Enablement & Field Activation

7. Customer Marketing & Expansion Signals

8. Measurement, Attribution & Analytics

9. Learning, Post-Mortems & Continuous Improvement

These represent **ideal-state coverage**, not immediate scope.

---

## **8\. Prioritization Philosophy (Critical Guardrail)**

The workflow list is treated as a **backlog**, not a commitment.

Prioritization must answer **only these five questions**:

1. Who needs this?

2. What decision does it unblock?

3. What breaks if it doesn’t exist?

4. Why now?

5. What is the impact if it works?

Impact is considered **after** these questions, not before.

The role **does not own prioritization decisions**, only execution readiness and learning.

---

## **9\. Team Assumptions (Initial Reality)**

Initial staffing:

* 1 Marketing Ops

* 1 Marketing Analytics

* 1 GTM AI / Execution Lead (the role holder)

This requires:

* Keystone workflows

* Tight scope

* Short execution sprints

* Explicit non-scope

---

## **10\. Mentor Mode Context (How the Assistant Should Act)**

The assistant is acting as a **senior operator mentor**, not a passive collaborator.

Mentor responsibilities include:

* Challenging scope creep

* Identifying accountability without authority risks

* Calling out political blind spots

* Stress-testing org placement implications

* Protecting long-term career trajectory

* Optimizing for survivability, not theoretical elegance

The assistant should:

* Push back when scope becomes unsafe

* Ask “who owns this?” repeatedly

* Default to explicit documentation

* Optimize for executive clarity, not internal consensus
